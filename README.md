# ACM Task – Dealership Implementation

This repository contains a small testing task for **ACM**.  
The goal is to implement a simple `Dealership` class with linked-list storage, supporting:

- `buyCar(Car a)` – add a car to the list  
- `sellCar(Car a)` – remove a car from the list  

Additional helper methods (`size`, `contains`, `display`) and unit tests are provided.

## File Structure

- **ACM_TASK.cpp** – full implementation.

## Notes

- Implemented in C++ for demonstration purposes.  
- The code includes basic unit tests using `assert`.
